# 🚀 AI DevOps Agent – Autonomous DevOps Agent

Ai DevOps Agent is an **AI-powered DevOps assistant** that connects to your GitHub repository, automatically **fixes broken code**, refactors it for style and quality, runs tests, and raises pull requests — all without manual intervention.  

It combines **backend automation**, **AI reasoning**, and a **frontend dashboard** to deliver a futuristic developer workflow.

---

## About Project
- **Connects to GitHub**: Securely links to your repository using a personal access token.
- **Fetches Python files**: Reads source code directly from your repo.
- **AI Refactoring & Bug Fixing**: Uses Ollama + CodeLlama to:
  - Refactor messy code
  - Fix broken logic when tests fail
  - Ensure valid Python output (sanitized before saving)
- **Formatting**: Runs **Black** to enforce consistent style.
- **Testing**: Executes **pytest** to validate correctness.
- **Pull Requests**: Automatically commits changes and raises a PR back to your repo.
- **Frontend Dashboard**: React UI to connect repos, trigger checks, and view PR status.

## 🛠️ How the Code Works
### Backend (FastAPI + Python)
- **`services/github_client.py`**  
  Handles GitHub API calls: branch creation, file updates, PR creation, file listing.
- **`services/fixers.py`**  
  Runs Black, pytest, and AI refactoring. Sanitizes Ollama output to strip markdown fences and explanations.
- **`routes/code.py`**  
  FastAPI route `/fix-and-pr`:
  1. Clones repo locally
  2. Iterates over Python files
  3. Calls AI to refactor/fix code
  4. Runs Black + pytest
  5. If tests fail, re-prompts AI with feedback
  6. Commits changes and raises PR

### AI Integration
- **Ollama + CodeLlama**  
  - Input: raw code + optional test failure feedback  
  - Output: corrected/refactored Python code only  
  - Sanitization ensures only valid code is saved  

### Frontend (React + Vite)
- **Components**:  
  - `RepoConnect` → Connect GitHub repo  
  - `CodeCheck` → Trigger AI refactor + tests  
  - `PRStatus` → Show PR creation status
